##How can I play on the Melia server?

Melia itself is not a server, it's a [server emulator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_emulator), it's not a service you can use, but a software that imitates behavior of another server software. We aren't operating any private servers and advise you to not do so either.

##How can I contribute to Melia?

Please take a look at the [Contribution section](http://github.com/aura-project/melia#contribution) of Melia's README file.
